Hi! My name is Ella Holland and I am a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University. 

I am taking the course Data Journalism to learn about the interdisciplinary work of reporting stories with data. This work is fascinating to me as I share a love for writing and math, and I believe that data is necessary to supporting the news stories that we see every day.

I am from Fairfield, Connecticut, and growing up outside of New York City, I have seen how news stories are necessary to daily life, along with the data that informs it. I am very excited to learn more about storytelling with data, especially in the groundbreaking events of this time! With data, we can educate and inform in tandem with stories.

## Lehigh Ethnic Makeup Statistics 2019

![Lehigh Diversity Demographics](https://github.com/ellaholland1/ellaholland1.github.io/blob/master/Lehigh%20Diversity%20Demographic.png?raw=true)

Lehigh University is a diverse institution with students from across the globe. In an effort to better understand the ethnic makeup of the university, data collected in 2019 gave insight into the diversity of the campus. The most prevalent ethnic group at the university is white, at 62% of the total population, showing a large majority of students come from a homogeneous background. Surprisingly, the next largest ethnic groups to the university are both non-resident aliens and Hispanics, showing Lehigh's popularity to international students and its global inclusion. As the list goes on, the sequential ethnic groups dwindle in numbers, with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population at less than 1% of the total. The implications of ethnic diversity at Lehigh are vast and multifaceted, but it is obvious that the culture of the school is dependent on the students and the backgrounds that contribute to it. With a majority of the population being white, Lehigh must make a concious effort to represent as many cultures and backgrounds as possible, and to create inclusion in all aspects of the collegiate experience.

## Human Development Index 2018

This data on the Human Development Index in 2018 compares every country in the world in their raw number HDI. Human Development Index is a statistic measure that evaluates life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators to rank countries into tiers, with 0 being the lowest development and 1 the highest. The bar graph allows every country to be compared side by side to evaluate the human development index of the entire globe. The list is in alphabetical order, and therefore shows the spread of values in a very randomized order.

## Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment 2015-19 Line Graph

This line graph shows Lehigh Undergraduate Enrollment from 2015-19 in the three undergraduate schools. Known since its beginning as a prominent engineering school, Lehigh engineering enrollment fluctuated over these years to allow for greater enrollment in the business and arts & science schools. These choices may make a statement about Lehigh's hope to create a more holistic approach to education and creating an inclusive feel in the liberal arts. These percentages show how these schools are changing year by year.

 ## Harvard Data on Parent and Child Income 
 
 This data shows the correlation between parent and child income, with regard to undergraduate studies. The graph shows a strong correlation between parent and child income, however interestingly enough there are few outliers where children have significantly higher incomes than their parents before them. Generational opportunity shows that children are most likely to have similar income as their parents before them. However, this correlation can be broken many times in the United States when students attend Ivy League or highly competetive schools, oftentimes as first generation students.

## Connecticut Confirmed COVID-19 Cases by Date

My home state of Connecticut faced a lot of adversity when it came to stopping the spread of COVID-19 when cases surged in early spring. I can remember March 12th, unbeknownst to me, my last day of senior year, and the strict quarantine to come for months. Connecticut, and especially my home of Fairfield County live symbiotically with New York City, the epicenter of the virus, facing tremendous loss in early spring. Governor Ned Lamont, and others like Governor Cuomo showed leadership by keeping faith in their communities while having to shut down their economies, something other states were too afraid to do. As this graph shows, since March, Connecticut has been able to "flatten the curve," a phrase that took to everyone's vocabularies this year. After extreme spikes in April, Connecticut has slowed the spread of coronavirus and hopefully can be an example of how to live for the common good in the tumultuous times of this pandemic.
