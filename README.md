Hi! My name is Ella Holland and I am a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University. 

I am taking the course Data Journalism to learn about the interdisciplinary work of reporting stories with data. This work is fascinating to me as I share a love for writing and math, and I believe that data is necessary to supporting the news stories that we see every day.

I am from Fairfield, Connecticut, and growing up outside of New York City, I have seen how news stories are necessary to daily life, along with the data that informs it. I am very excited to learn more about storytelling with data, especially in the groundbreaking events of this time! With data, we can educate and inform in tandem with stories.

## Lehigh Ethnic Makeup Statistics 2019

![Lehigh Diversity Demographics](https://github.com/ellaholland1/ellaholland1.github.io/blob/master/Lehigh%20Diversity%20Demographic.png?raw=true)

Lehigh University is a diverse institution with students from across the globe. In an effort to better understand the ethnic makeup of the university, data collected in 2019 gave insight into the diversity of the campus. The most prevalent ethnic group at the university is white, at 62% of the total population, showing a large majority of students come from a homogeneous background. Surprisingly, the next largest ethnic groups to the university are both non-resident aliens and Hispanics, showing Lehigh's popularity to international students and its global inclusion. As the list goes on, the sequential ethnic groups dwindle in numbers, with Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander population at less than 1% of the total. The implications of ethnic diversity at Lehigh are vast and multifaceted, but it is obvious that the culture of the school is dependent on the students and the backgrounds that contribute to it. With a majority of the population being white, Lehigh must make a concious effort to represent as many cultures and backgrounds as possible, and to create inclusion in all aspects of the collegiate experience.
