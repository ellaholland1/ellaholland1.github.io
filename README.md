Hi! My name is Ella Holland and I am a freshman in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University. 

I am taking the course Data Journalism to learn about the interdisciplinary work of reporting stories with data. This work is fascinating to me as I share a love for writing and math, and I believe that data is necessary to supporting the news stories that we see every day.

I am from Fairfield, Connecticut, and growing up outside of New York City, I have seen how news stories are necessary to daily life, along with the data that informs it. I am very excited to learn more about storytelling with data, especially in the groundbreaking events of this time! With data, we can educate and inform in tandem with stories.
